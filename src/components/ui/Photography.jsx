      Photography is my creative, enabling me a way to capture time and seeing things in ways many times goes unnoticed. I love trying different angles, light and compositions to capture the beauty of life in simple everyday situations. Be it landscapes, candid shots or street photography experiments â€” framing that perfect shot seemed as exhilarating as meditating to these creators. I find that photography helps me get more into my artistic side and provides some balance to the technical aspects of my life.
